This project is meant to be my attempt to mimic the functionality of Cookie Clicker using Java GUI. 

The Cookie Clicker I tried to recreate is based on Cookie Clicker Classic, which can be found here: https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/

This project demonstrates usage of event handling and Timers, as well as Java Inheritance, Enums, Polymorphism, Java Buttons, and Java GUI.

I had a hard time getting the Java Image Icons working so unfortunately they do not pop up, perhaps in future projects I make I will be able to get them working.
