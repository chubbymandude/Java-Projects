This project can be used to see the step-by-step algorithm of classical sorting algorithms, including
BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, and QuickSort. It also provides the algorithm
for Linear Search and Binary Search.

Note that for MergeSort and QuickSort, the program only performs one pass of each algorithm, as the point
is to demonstrate functionality and trying to cover the whole algorithm would become a hassle
due to the nature of recursion in such algorithms.
