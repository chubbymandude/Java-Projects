This Calculator project can be used to calculate basic mathematical expressions with +, -, *, /, %, and ^. It also allows usage of the PI and e constants.

The program uses a GUI and performs calculation using postfix notation. The user inputs a String mathematical expression which is first converted into
prefix before it is used to calculate the expression.
